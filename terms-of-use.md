# Terms of Use
_Last updated: November 16, 2025_

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Steady app (“the App”) provided by **Dominik Zak**.  
By downloading, installing, or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.

If you do not agree with these Terms, please do not use the App.

## 1. Subscriptions and Payment

Steady offers auto-renewing subscription plans that unlock premium features.  
Subscriptions and payments are processed through **Apple’s App Store** using your Apple ID account.

- Payment is charged to your Apple ID upon confirmation of purchase.  
- Prices and available subscription plans are displayed in the App and may vary by region.

## 2. Auto-Renewal

Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless you cancel at least **24 hours** before the current period ends.

- Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.  
- The cost of renewal will be the same as the price you initially agreed to, unless it changes and Apple notifies you.

## 3. Free Trial and Introductory Offers

If a free trial or introductory offer is available:

- Only **eligible users** (as determined by Apple) may use the trial or offer.  
- The trial period will be specified in the App (e.g., 3 days).  
- After the trial ends, your subscription will automatically convert to a paid subscription at the regular price unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial period ends.  
- Free trials and introductory offers are typically limited to one per Apple ID per subscription group.

Eligibility and application of introductory offers are controlled by **Apple**, not directly by us.

## 4. Managing or Canceling Your Subscription

You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings:

1. Open the **Settings** app on your device.  
2. Tap your name at the top.  
3. Tap **Subscriptions**.  
4. Select the Steady subscription and choose **Cancel Subscription** or change your plan.

When you cancel, your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period.  
We cannot cancel subscriptions or issue refunds directly—those are handled by Apple.

## 5. Use of the App

You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.

You agree **not** to:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.  
- Circumvent or attempt to circumvent subscription or access controls.  
- Use the App in any way that violates applicable laws or regulations.

## 6. User Data

All app data (habits, activities, schedules, progress, and settings) is stored **locally on your device**.  
We do not collect or store this data on our own servers.

If you delete the App, all data stored within the App on your device may be permanently deleted and cannot be restored by us.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All content, features, and functionality of the App — including but not limited to design, text, graphics, icons, and code — are the property of **Dominik Zak** and are protected by applicable intellectual property laws.

You are granted a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to use the App solely for your own personal, non-commercial use.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

We make no warranties, express or implied, regarding:

- The accuracy or completeness of any content in the App.  
- The availability, reliability, or performance of the App.

Your use of the App is at your own risk.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, **Dominik Zak** shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the App or these Terms.

## 10. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time.  
If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
